# Flight-Booking-Moblie-App-Project

Developing flight booking mobile app by using with React-Native (Demo version)
The UAM (Urban Air Mobility) industry has many potential systems and technology to be developed.
I am doing this project as a demo about flight booking mobile app for airtaxi.

# Working in Progress...-ing

This is the draft design of the flight booking option page.
I assumed that there are some airtaxis that users can choose by each different options.
